## Introduction

**WEBMIDI.js** makes it easy to interact with MIDI instruments directly from a web browser or from 
Node.js. It simplifies the control of physical or virtual MIDI instruments with user-friendly 
functions such as `playNote()`, `sendPitchBend()` or `sendControlChange()`. It also allows reacting 
to inbound MIDI messages by adding listeners for events such as `"noteon"`, `"pitchbend"` or 
`"programchange"`.

In short, the goal behind WEBMIDI.js is to get you started with your web-based MIDI project as quickly
and efficiently as possible.

## Getting Started

The [**official website**](https://webmidijs.org) site is the best place to get started. Over there,
you will find, amongst others, two key resources:

* [Documentation](https://webmidijs.org/docs/)
* [API Reference](https://webmidijs.org/api/)

To exchange with fellow users and myself, you can visit our [**Forum**](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/discussions)
which is hosted on the GitHub Discussions platform:
