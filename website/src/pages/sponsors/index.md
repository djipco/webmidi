## About Software Development...

As you surely know, proper software development takes time. This time is spent on coding new
features but also on various other important tasks such as writing useful documentation, answering
questions, reviewing issues, fixing bugs, writing tests, etc.

While WEBMIDI.js started as a hobby project, it is quietly becoming the "go to" library for MIDI on
the web. Hopefully, your contributions will make allow me to continue developing, maintaining and
advocating for this project that I cherish.

Thank you so much. üòÄ
