# Roadmap for version 3.x

## Enhancements Still Remaining

* Publish TypeScript definitions to 
[DefinitelyTyped](https://definitelytyped.org/guides/contributing.html) when v3 is stable (they are
currently available in the `dist` directory)

* Adjust `InputChannel.EVENTS` to include all `controlchange-xxx` events

* Add `inputconnected`, `inputdisconnected`, `outputconnected` and `outputdisconnected` events.

## Enhancement Already Baked In

* Added triggering of `portschanged` event in `WebMidi` object (v3.0.2).

* Add `filter` option to allow listening to only a subset of events (e.g. specific controller change
or NRPN messages, discussed in [PR #88](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/pull/88))

* Add a way to forward inbound messages on an `Input` object to an `Output` (to behave like a 
physical MIDI THRU port). This could be expanded to a more elaborate filtering and routing system 
([example](https://github.com/shemeshg/RtMidiWrap#routing-configuration))

* Add mechanism to Generate TypeScript type definitions (.d.ts files)

* Add `getNoteState()` method to `InputChannel` so it it is possible to check if a note is currently 
playing or not. This allows to check for chords when a **noteon** message is received.

* Properly handle when a laptop's lid is closed then reopened
([Issue #140](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/issues/140))

* As suggested by users, allow sending MSB and LSB at once when sending control change messages 
([Issue #57](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/issues/57)). This would have to be done for CC 
messages 0-31 which all have a matching LSB.

* Rewrite the NRPN parsing mechanism in InputChannel. I do not think it works correctly. Here are 
starting points:

  - http://tetradev.blogspot.com/2010/03/nrpns-part-2-nrpns-in-ableton-with-max.html
  - https://www.elektronauts.com/t/nrpn-tutorial-how-to/46669
  - http://www.philrees.co.uk/nrpnq.htm
  

* Allow `sendSysex()` to accept `Uint8Array` ([Issue #124](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/issues/124), [forum thread](https://webmidijs.org/forum/discussion/comment/97#Comment_97)) or perhaps to accept a `Message` object that can be built from a `Uint8Array` (this needs to be carefully examined)

* Add a `Message` object

* Add the ability to set default values for attack velocity, release velocity, etc. ( see [forum discussion](https://webmidijs.org/forum/discussion/44/things-in-webmidi-js-2-52-that-make-me-go-huh#latest))

* Various utility methods should probably be stashed in a `Utils` class (e.g. getCcNameByNumber(), etc.)

* Add convenience method to convert float and 7 bit: `to7bit()` and `toNormalized()`

* Add the ability to individually transpose `Input`, `Output`, `InputChannel` and `OutputChannel`.

* Add `InputChannel` and `OutputChannel` objects ([Issue #20](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/issues/20))

* Use ES6+ modern syntax and add default export so library can be imported with `import`
(Issues [#49](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/issues/49) and [#89](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/issues/89))

* Move to Rollup for packaging the library ([Issue #61](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/issues/61))

* Drop support for Bower ([Issue #60](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/issues/60))

* Extend a proper event library to allow for modern event support (probably 
[djipevents](https://github.com/djipco/djipevents)).

* Implement port `statechange` events (`connected` and `disconnected`)

* Make `WebMidi` a singleton (see example
[here](https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-design-patterns-singleton/))

* WebMidi should dispatch 'enabled' and 'disabled' event

* Check that disable() really does disable everything

* Add methods for channel mode messages

* Implement `clear()` method ([Issue #52](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/issues/52)) [this will 
automatically work when browsers add support for it but will show a warning in the console until 
then).

* Added the new ([software](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/#dom-midioptions)) parameter for
`requestMIDIAccess` [this will automatically work when browsers add support for it).

* Emit events for all channel mode messages

* Add `statusByte` and `dataBytes` properties to the event triggered when receiving messages 
([#109](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/issues/109))

* Deprecate the ability to send on all channels (default behaviour). This clogs up the MIDI stream
and I do not really see a good use case for it.

* Create a `Note` object with `duration` and `velocity` property

* Add official support for Node.js ([Issue #15](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/issues/15))

* Allow specifying different note durations and velocities in `playNote()` when using arrays 
([Issue #75](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/issues/75) and 
[#90](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/issues/90)). [this is now possible with `Note` objects].

* Add [editorconfig file](https://atom.io/packages/editorconfig)

* Complete test suite for all objects

* Add `sendRaw()` method accepting either list of integers or `Uint8Array`.

* Allow `send()` to accept `Uint8Array`
