# TypeScript

TypeScript is supported in version 3+. However, it has not yet been tested extensively and some 
minor issues may remain.

For instance, some types have been defined as `any` for lack of a better option. One such example 
has been described in 
[issue 229](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/issues/229#issuecomment-1039036353). If you are a 
TypeScript expert, perhaps you can help.
